                    For humans there is the particular crisis of bipedal erect posture to be processed. I was increasingly aware that all my real problems were modalities of back-pain, or phylogenetic spinal injury, which took me back to the calamitous consequences of the precambrian explosion, roughly five hundred million years ago. The ensuing period is incrementally body-mapped by metazoan organization. Obviously there are discrete quasi-coherent neuromotor tic-flux patterns, whose incrementally rigidified stages are swimming, crawling, and (bipedal) walking. Elaine Morgan persuasively traces the origin of protohuman bipedalism to certain deleterious plate-tectonic shifts. The model is bioseismic. Crustal convulsions and animal body-plan are rigorously interconnected, and the entire Aquatic Ape Theory constitutes an exemplary geotraumatic analysis. Erect posture and perpendicularization of the skull is a frozen calamity, associated with a long list of pathological consequences, amongst which should be included most of the human psychoneuroses. Numerous trends in contemporary culture attest to an attempted recovery of the icthyophidian- or flexomotile-spine: horizontal and impulsive rather than vertical and stress-bearing.

                <div class="smalltext padding3 sans">
                    In 1733, William Chesleden published Osteographia, a grand folio edition depicting human and animal bones, featuring beautiful copperplate images, including playful skeletons, vignettes, and initials. He depicts all the bones of the human body separately in their actual life size "and again reduced in order to shew them united to one another." Cheselden and his engravers, Gerard van der Gucht and Mr. Shinevoet, employed a camera obscura to execute many of the images, and the practice is depicted in the title page vignette. The work, which was most likely printed for Cheselden by William Bowyer, was unfortunately a financial failure, as his bid for subscribers was met "with little success," which was the case with so many large anatomical atlases of the period.

                <div class="smalltext padding3 sans">Bartholomew Eustachius was a famous Italian anatomist of his time . He was born between 1500-1524, although the exact date is unknown. The Eustachian Tube is named after him.

                When Eustachi’s Opuscula anatomica was first published in 1564, it contained eight plates, mainly focusing on the kidneys and vascular system. More than 130 years after his death, however, Giovanni Maria Lancisi found another thirty-eight copperplates engraved by Giulio de' Musi for a planned work of Eustachi’s, but the text to accompany the plates was never found. Lancisi published the plates with his own explanations in Rome in 1714 under the title Tabulae anatomicae Bartholomaei Eustachii. A unique feature of Eustachi’s plates is the use of printed, numbered rulers on the edges which could be used in the text to locate anatomical structures without the use of letters or numbers in the images.

                    6. Charles Estienne, On the dissection of parts of the human body, book three, 1545
                </div>
                <div class="smalltext padding3 sans">
                    'This magnificent folio volume is one of the finest of all anatomical treatises. Certainly it was the finest printed in France in its century, and the sixty-two full-page woodcuts, artistically presenting the anatomical subjects in special poses before unusual background settings, are particularly sumptuous and imaginative. The anatomy itself is pre-Vesalian in conception and far from being as accurate as that of Vesalius. Some of the plates show diseased as well as normal anatomy' . 'Charles Estienne [scion of the famous Estienne family of printers] studied medicine in Paris, completing his training in 1540; in 1535, during his course of anatomical studies under Jacques Dubois, he had Andreas Vesalius as a classmate. At the time the only illustrated manuals of dissection available were the writings of Berengario da Carpi, and the need for an improved, well-illustrated manual must have been obvious to all students of anatomy, particularly the medical student son of one of the world's leading publishers. Estienne did not hesitate to fill this need. The manuscript and illustrations for ^De Dissectione^ were completed by 1539, and the book was set in type halfway through Book 3 and the last section, when publication was stopped by a lawsuit brought by Étienne de la Rivière, an obscure surgeon and anatomist who had attended lectures at the Paris faculty during 1533-1536, overlapping the time of Estienne's medical study in Paris. According to historian of surgery and economist, François Quesnay, Estienne may have attempted to plagiarize a manuscript of Étienne de la Rivière which the latter had turned over to him for translation from French into Latin. In the eventual settlement of the lawsuit, Estienne was required to credit Rivière for the various anatomical preparations and for the pictures of the dissections. Had ^De Dissectione^ been published in 1539, there is no question that it would have stolen much of the thunder from Vesalius's ^Fabrica^: it would have been the first work to show detailed illustrations of dissection in serial progression, the first to discuss and illustrate the total human body, the first to publish instructions on how to mount a skeleton, and the first to set the anatomical figures in a fully developed panoramic landscape, a tradition begun by Berengario da Carpi in his ^Commentary on Mondino^. Nonetheless, Estienne's work still contained numerous original contributions to anatomy, including the first published illustrations of the whole external venous and nervous systems, and descriptions of the morphology and purpose of the "feeding holes" of bones, the tripartite composition of the sternum, the valvulae in the hepatic veins and the scrotal septum. In addition, the work's eight dissections of the brain provide more anatomical detail that had previously appeared'. The woodcuts largely depict full-length figures, with the dissected portions cut on smaller blocks set into the larger block for printing, suggesting that the larger blocks may initially have been cut for another purpose.

                    7. Leonardo da Vinci, Recto The skeleton, 1510
                </div>
                <div class="smalltext padding3 sans">
                    This page constitutes the most complete representation of a skeleton in the whole of Leonardo’s surviving oeuvre. The vertebral curvature and oblique rib placement are well shown, and the drawing at lower right captures the correct tilt of the pelvic girdle, with a thread from the anterior surface of the ilium through the patella to the tibia illustrating the action of the quadriceps.

                    Whether Leonardo had attempted to visualise a complete skeleton or had actually joined dried bones back together, some errors of detail were perhaps inevitable. The scapula is too long (it should extend from around rib 2 to rib 8); the humerus is well drawn throughout, but the trochlea – the depression in the middle of its lower end, for articulation with the ulna – is on the wrong side of the humerus. In the side view at upper right, the angle of descent of the first two ribs is too acute, the front-to-back dimension of the thorax is somewhat excessive, and the last two floating ribs are far too long.
                    
                    In the drawing at lower left, the articulations of the clavicle and first rib with the manubrium (labelled m) appear accurate, and Leonardo correctly places the articulation of the second rib at the sternal angle, where the manubrium joins the body of the sternum. But he shows separate sternal segments, and an odd arrangement of the lower ribs, in particular their cartilaginous connection to the sternum. He also depicts the acromion (the process of the scapula at the furthest point of the shoulder) as a separate bone: that this was deliberate is confirmed in a note, ‘First depict the shoulder without the bone a, and then put it in’. In the young the acromion is connected to the body of the scapula by cartilage that later ossifies, and in some individuals it can remain separate, but elsewhere in the manuscript Leonardo plainly shows the acromion as a part of the scapula.
                    
                    Verso: two studies of a head in profile to the right, showing facial muscles; a right arm and shoulder in profle to the right; a study of a right arm and hand seen from in front; two studies of a right hand, with the palm towards the spectator, showing arteries and nerves; the head of a man with curly hair, in profile to the right.
                    
                    Leonardo fits a remarkable amount of information onto this page. There are three main subjects: the hand; the muscles of the shoulder and arm, and the muscles of the face, a subject treated nowhere else in Manuscript A.
                    
                    The two studies of the hand are labelled 5th and 6th, and thus continue the sequence. The drawing to the left depicts the entry of the median and ulnar nerves into the hand, with the correct distribution of the nerves for cutaneous sensation. The fibrous tendon sheaths are fully indicated, as is the transverse carpal ligament, with the median nerve and long flexors of the fingers passing through the carpal tunnel. In the drawing to the right the ulnar artery enters the palm and forms the superficial palmar arch, with the common palmar and proper palmar digital arteries distinct. Running across the palm is the superficial transverse metacarpal ligament.
                    The studies of the facial muscles are highly accurate. The drawing to the left depicts the superficial muscles, notoriously difficult to dissect as they may originate and/or insert into the deep surface of the skin. We see part of the complex of muscles that raise the upper lip, and Leonardo reminds himself to see if this is the same muscle structure that raises the nares (nostrils) of the horse. He attempted to identify the function of each muscle in the surrounding notes: ‘h is the muscle of anger; p is the muscle of sorrow; g is the muscle for biting; o t is the muscle of anger’. Leonardo also reminds himself to determine whether the nerves that cause movement in the face issue directly from the brain – he has comprehended the difference between spinal nerves and cranial nerves. In the second drawing some of the superficial facial muscles have been removed to reveal the deeper structures.

                    The first incision of a dissection, from Guido de Vigevano’s work dedicated to Phillip VI of France.

                    A decaying body stands before us. Its pale skin stretches taut across a scaffold of bones: joints knobby, ribs protruding, fingers and toes emaciated to brittle fragments, eyelids thinly sealed, dreaming of a past life. From behind, an anatomist cradles the body and boldly carves open its chest with a surgical knife. Though the stroke is violent, the anatomist emanates a strange tenderness for the corpse; his labor seems caught somewhere between butchering and embracing. Through a crimson gash in the chest, the anatomist inserts his hand and prepares to peel back the skin; in a moment the body will open. This uncanny scene comes to us from a fourteenth-century anatomical treatise designed by an Italian physician named Guido da Vigevano. Now held in the library of the Musée Condé in Chantilly, France, it is one of eighteen such images that illustrate this short work, titled the Anothomia Philippi Septimi, dedicated in 1345 to Guido’s patron King Philip VI of France. Though unique in many respects, Guido’s treatise is most notable for scenes of human dissection, which present the contents of the three venters, or principle cavities of the body (abdomen, chest, and skull).

Although the exact purpose of these "wound man" images — which appear in numerous other 15th and 16th-century works — is not known, they appear to be some attempt to communicate all the different injuries to which the body can be subjected, in some cases offering up accompanying treatments. The author of this particular treatise is unknown, though it is attributed to Pseudo-Galen, meaning that the inspiration for the work might have come by (or it is attempting to be passed off) as the work of the Greek physician Claudius Galenus, also known as Galen of Pergamon, who wrote extensively on medicine. The illustrations in this treatise, in addition to possessing a certain naive charm, are of interest as being the prototypes of those found in Johannes de Ketham's Fasciculus Medicine, first printed in 1491.

                    The Canon of Medicine is an encyclopedia of medicine in five books compiled by Muslim Persian physician-philosopher Avicenna (ابن سینا, ibn Sina) and completed in 1025. It is among the most influential works of its time. It presents an overview of the contemporary medical knowledge of the Islamic world, which had been influenced by earlier traditions including Greco-Roman medicine (particularly Galen), Persian medicine, Chinese medicine and Indian medicine. Its translation from Arabic to Latin in 12th century Toledo greatly influenced the development of medieval medicine. It became the standard textbook for teaching in European universities into the early modern period.

                    The Canon of Medicine remained a medical authority for centuries. It set the standards for medicine in Medieval Europe and the Islamic world and was used as a standard medical textbook through the 18th century in Europe. It is an important text in Unani medicine, a form of traditional medicine practiced in India.
